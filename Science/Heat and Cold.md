Questions and Terms
### HVAC means Heating, Ventilation, Air Conditioning
### How much money does the industry make?
12 billion CAD in Canada.
### What are the different ways of maintaining or recovering temperature?
Sweating, Electronics, Panting, or, Flapping Wings (for bees) are some answers. 
### Life forms are sensitive to temperature
### Heat
the quality of being <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">hot; high temperature</mark>
### Kinetic Energy
Kinetic energy is a property of a moving object or particle and depends not only on its motion but also on its mass.
### Temperature
the degree or intensity of heat present in a substance or object, especially as expressed according to <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Celsius and Fahrenheit</mark> and shown by a thermometer.

### Thermal Contraction
Thermal contraction is the <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">shrinking of materials as they cool</mark>, the opposite of thermal expansion, where materials expand when heated. This occurs because as temperature decreases, the atoms and molecules within a substance <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">move slower and closer together</mark>,
### Thermal Expansion
Thermal expansion is the tendency of matter to<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;"> increase in length, area, or volume</mark>, changing its <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">size and density</mark>, in response to an increase in temperature.
