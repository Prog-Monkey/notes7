- Have reasonableness to you measurement data
- Tables with style
- Make use of functions(sheets)

| Name    | Wingspan(cm) | Height(cm) | Ratio   | Proportion   |
| ------- | ------------ | ---------- | ------- | ------------ |
| Haveesh | 200          | 400        | 200/400 | 0.5          |
| Aanya   | 250          | 300        |         | 0.8333333333 |
## Methods
### How to find proportions
Wingspan and height ratio but simplified e.g 200/400 = 0.5
